## 🎨 Design Guidelines for Text Overlays

### Typography
**Headline (Top Text):**
- Font: Bold, Sans-serif (Arial Black, Helvetica Bold, Montserrat Bold)
- Size: 72-96pt

- Alignment: Center

**Subtext (Bottom Text):**
- Font: Regular or Medium Sans-serif
- Size: 48-60pt
- Color: Gray or light color

- Use bullet points (•) to separate phrases

### Layout
**Safe Areas:**
- Top overlay: 200px from top
- Bottom overlay: 200px from bottom
- Side margins: 100px on each side

**Background Treatment:**
- Add semi-transparent overlay bar behind text (black at 40% opacity)
- OR use drop shadow on text for readability
- Ensure high contrast between text and background

### Brand Colors
- Primary: Black (#000000)
- Accent: Gold (#FFD700) - Use sparingly for highlights

- Believable lap times
- Proper racing terminology

### 2. Show, Don't Tell

- Remove notification badges

### 4. Think Mobile-First
- Text must be readable on small screens
- High contrast is critical

- Don't overcrowd with information

### 5. Test on Actual Devices
- What looks good on desktop may not translate
- View screenshots on phone before submitting
- Check readability at actual size
- Get feedback from real users
