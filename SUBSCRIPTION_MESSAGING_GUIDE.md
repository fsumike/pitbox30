## Support Response Templates

Great question! Here's the breakdown:

🆓 FREE (No subscription needed):
• Racing Community (posts, stories, chat)
• Swap Meet Marketplace
• All 11 Racing Tools & Calculators
• Track Locations & Events
• Groups & Challenges

💰 PAID (Subscription required):
• Racing Setup Sheets only
  → Save unlimited setups
  → Sync across devices
  → $9.99/month (Basic)

Try the 7-day free trial to test it out!

Let me know if you have other questions!
```

### "Why do I have to pay to save setups?"

```
I totally understand the question! Here's why:

The FREE features (Community, Swap Meet, Tools) don't require expensive cloud storage. They're there to help everyone race better!

Racing setup sheets require:
✓ Secure cloud storage
✓ Real-time sync across devices
✓ Backup and history tracking
✓ Advanced encryption (Premium)

This infrastructure costs money to maintain. At $9.99/month, we're keeping it affordable while providing reliable service.

Think of it this way:
• Community = Free hangout
• Setup Sheets = Your private garage (costs to maintain)

We want everyone to connect and share racing knowledge for free, but your competitive setups deserve premium protection.

Try the 7-day free trial - if it doesn't save you time and wins, cancel anytime!

Does that make sense?
```

---

### "How do I cancel?"

```
No problem! You can cancel anytime.

📱 iPhone/iPad:
1. Open Settings app
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap "Subscriptions"
4. Select "PitBox"
5. Tap "Cancel Subscription"

🤖 Android:
1. Open Google Play Store
2. Tap menu → "Subscriptions"
3. Select "PitBox"
4. Tap "Cancel subscription"

🌐 Or cancel directly in the PitBox app:
Settings → Account → Manage Subscription → Cancel

After canceling:
✅ You keep all FREE features (Community, Swap Meet, Tools)
✅ You can still view your saved setups (read-only)
❌ You can't create new setup sheets or edit existing ones

Your subscription stays active until the end of your billing period, then you won't be charged again.

Want to share why you're canceling? We'd love the feedback!

### "Can I get a refund?"

```
I'd be happy to help with that!

🤖 Android (Google):

For PitBox-specific issues (like technical problems), let me know and I'll help resolve them! Sometimes we can fix the issue and you won't need a refund.

What prompted the refund request? Maybe I can help!

## App Store Review Responses

### Negative: "Too expensive"

```
Hi [Name], thanks for the feedback!

Just to clarify - most of PitBox is FREE including the entire Racing Community, Swap Meet marketplace, and all 11 Racing Tools.

You only need a subscription ($9.99/mo) if you want to save and sync racing setup sheets across devices.

We work hard to keep costs low while providing secure, reliable cloud storage for your competitive setups.

We'd love another chance! Try the 7-day free trial and let us know if the value makes sense. If not, you still get all the free features.

Thanks for being part of the PitBox community!
```

---

### Positive: "Love the free features!"

This made our day! 🎉

We believe racing knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone. That's why Community, Swap Meet, and Tools will always be free!

If you ever want to save your racing setups, we've got a premium option for that. But no pressure - keep enjoying the free stuff!

Thanks for the awesome review!
