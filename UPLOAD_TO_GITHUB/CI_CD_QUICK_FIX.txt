CI/CD QUICK FIX - START HERE!
===============================================

YOUR BUILD IS FAILING WITH:
"[error] android platform has not been added yet."

SUPER SIMPLE FIX (3 STEPS):

===============================================
STEP 1: UPLOAD TO GITHUB
===============================================

You're reading this, so you've already got the files!

Just upload the package.json from this folder to your GitHub repo root.

Using Git:
  git add package.json
  git commit -m "Fix CI/CD build"
  git push

Using GitHub Web:
  1. Go to your repo on GitHub.com
  2. Click on package.json
  3. Click Edit (pencil icon)
  4. Copy/paste from the package.json in this folder
  5. Commit changes

===============================================
STEP 2: UPDATE IONIC APPFLOW
===============================================

Go to your Ionic AppFlow Dashboard:

1. Click your app
2. Go to: Build → Build Configuration
3. Find: "Build Script" or "npm script"
4. Change from: build
5. Change to: build:ci
6. Click Save

That's it!

===============================================
STEP 3: BUILD AGAIN
===============================================

In Ionic AppFlow:

1. Go to: Build → New Build
2. Select: Android
3. Click: Start Build
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. ✅ Success!

===============================================
WHAT THIS DOES
===============================================

Your package.json now has a new script called "build:ci" that:

1. Adds Android platform (npx cap add android)
2. Builds your web app (vite build)
3. Syncs to Android (npx cap sync android)

All automatic! No more "platform not added" error.

===============================================
WHY IT WAS FAILING
===============================================

Your .gitignore excludes the android/ folder, so it's not in Git.
The CI/CD runner needs that folder to build.

This fix generates the android/ folder automatically during build.
Problem solved!

===============================================
IF YOU STILL GET ERRORS
===============================================

Different error? Check these:

Gradle errors (version incompatible):
→ See: FIX_GRADLE_ERROR.txt

General build issues:
→ See: COMPLETE_ANDROID_GUIDE.txt

Local development help:
→ Use: android-build.sh

===============================================
FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
===============================================

Your local workflow is UNCHANGED!

Use the build script:
  chmod +x android-build.sh
  ./android-build.sh build

Or manually:
  npm run build
  npx cap sync android
  npx cap open android

The build:ci script is ONLY for CI/CD!

===============================================
VERIFICATION
===============================================

After Step 2, trigger a build and check the log.

You should see:
  ✓ Adding native android project
  ✓ Building web app
  ✓ Syncing to Android
  ✓ Build successful

If you see all those checkmarks: YOU'RE DONE! 🎉

===============================================
THAT'S IT!
===============================================

Three simple steps:
1. ✅ Upload package.json to GitHub
2. ✅ Change AppFlow build script to "build:ci"
3. ✅ Build again

Your Android builds will now work! 🚀
