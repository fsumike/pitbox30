FINAL CHECKLIST - MAKE SURE YOU DID EVERYTHING
===============================================

Use this checklist to verify you completed all steps!

===============================================
PART 1: FILE UPLOAD
===============================================

[ ] Downloaded/copied the UPLOAD_TO_GITHUB folder
[ ] Opened your project folder
[ ] Copied package.json to project root
[ ] Replaced old package.json with new one
[ ] Copied android-build.sh to project root (optional)
[ ] Made android-build.sh executable: chmod +x android-build.sh

===============================================
PART 2: GIT COMMIT
===============================================

[ ] Opened terminal in project folder
[ ] Ran: git status (to see changes)
[ ] Saw package.json as modified
[ ] Ran: git add package.json
[ ] Ran: git add android-build.sh (if you added it)
[ ] Ran: git commit -m "Fix CI/CD Android build"
[ ] Ran: git push
[ ] Verified push succeeded (no errors)

===============================================
PART 3: VERIFY ON GITHUB
===============================================

[ ] Went to your GitHub repo in browser
[ ] Clicked on package.json
[ ] Looked for "build:ci" in scripts section
[ ] Found this line: "build:ci": "npx cap add android && vite build && npx cap sync android"
[ ] Latest commit shows your "Fix CI/CD" message

===============================================
PART 4: IONIC APPFLOW SETTINGS
===============================================

[ ] Logged into Ionic AppFlow dashboard
[ ] Selected PitBox app
[ ] Went to: Build → Build Configuration
[ ] Found "Build Script" or "npm Script" setting
[ ] Changed from "build" to "build:ci"
[ ] Clicked Save
[ ] Verified setting saved correctly

===============================================
PART 5: TEST BUILD
===============================================

[ ] In AppFlow: Build → New Build
[ ] Selected: Android
[ ] Clicked: Start Build
[ ] Waited for build (2-4 minutes)
[ ] Checked build log
[ ] Saw: "Adding native android project" ✓
[ ] Saw: "npm run build:ci" ✓
[ ] Saw: "✓ Syncing complete!" ✓
[ ] Build status: SUCCESS ✅

===============================================
PART 6: DOWNLOAD & TEST
===============================================

[ ] Downloaded APK/AAB from AppFlow
[ ] Transferred to Android device
[ ] Installed on device
[ ] App launches successfully
[ ] Basic features work (login, navigation, etc.)
[ ] No immediate crashes

===============================================
OPTIONAL: LOCAL TESTING
===============================================

[ ] Tested locally: npm run build:ci
[ ] Saw android folder created
[ ] No errors in console
[ ] Tested build script: ./android-build.sh build
[ ] Opened in Android Studio: ./android-build.sh open

===============================================
TROUBLESHOOTING (IF SOMETHING FAILED)
===============================================

Package.json not updated on GitHub:
[ ] Check git push worked (git log)
[ ] Verify correct branch (git branch)
[ ] Try pushing again
[ ] Check GitHub permissions

AppFlow settings not saving:
[ ] Try different browser
[ ] Clear cache and cookies
[ ] Disable ad blockers
[ ] Check you have admin access

Build still failing:
[ ] Read build log carefully
[ ] Look for specific error message
[ ] Check: FIX_GRADLE_ERROR.txt for Gradle issues
[ ] Check: COMPLETE_ANDROID_GUIDE.txt for other issues
[ ] Verify package.json on GitHub has build:ci

Different error now:
[ ] That's progress! Original issue fixed
[ ] Read error carefully
[ ] See FIX_GRADLE_ERROR.txt
[ ] See COMPLETE_ANDROID_GUIDE.txt

===============================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
===============================================

You're done when ALL of these are true:

✅ package.json is on GitHub with build:ci script
✅ AppFlow build script is set to "build:ci"
✅ New build completes successfully in AppFlow
✅ APK/AAB file downloads
✅ App installs and runs on device

If ANY are not checked, go back and fix that step!

===============================================
WHAT'S NEXT?
===============================================

After successful build:

1. Test thoroughly on device
2. Fix any Gradle warnings (see FIX_GRADLE_ERROR.txt)
3. Build release version (signed)
4. Test release build
5. Upload to Google Play Console
6. Submit for review
7. Launch! 🚀

===============================================
KEEP THESE FILES
===============================================

Save these for reference:
- CI_CD_QUICK_FIX.txt
- COMPLETE_ANDROID_GUIDE.txt
- FIX_GRADLE_ERROR.txt
- android-build.sh

You'll need them for:
- Future builds
- Troubleshooting
- Team members
- Documentation

===============================================
ONGOING MAINTENANCE
===============================================

For every code change:

Local development:
  npm run build
  npx cap sync android

CI/CD (AppFlow):
  git push
  → Automatic build with build:ci

Local Android build:
  ./android-build.sh build
  ./android-build.sh open

===============================================
YOU DID IT! 🎉
===============================================

If all checkboxes are marked, you've successfully:

✅ Fixed CI/CD Android build
✅ Updated package.json
✅ Configured Ionic AppFlow
✅ Built APK successfully
✅ Tested on device

Congratulations! Your Android app is building! 🚀
